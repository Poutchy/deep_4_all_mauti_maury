You are preparing a team for a turn-based tactical dungeon run.

Mission:
- Map: Rotting Catacombs
- Difficulty: Nightmare
- Fight length: long encounters expected
- Main threats: undead with high protection, heavy stress damage
- Retreat chance: low
- Death of one hero = mission failure

Available heroes:
- Crusader A — high protection, taunt, bonus vs undead, poor stress resistance
- Crusader B — medium protection, small team heal, low damage
- Vestal — reliable healing, stress cleanse, very slow
- Occultist — unstable big heals, can mark enemies, risk self-bleed
- Arbalest — ranged damage, mark synergy, ignores part of protection
- Jester — strong stress heal, speed buffs, low direct damage
- Flagellant — self-heal, bleed synergy, unstable at low HP
- Shadow Rogue — very high burst damage, very fragile

Constraints:
- Team size: choose exactly 3 heroes
- You expect protection-heavy enemies
- Stress is the primary failure cause
- No duplicate gear bonuses active

Which is the best team of 3 heroes to choose?
